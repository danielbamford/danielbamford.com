            <h2>The Brutal Truth About Technical Hiring in Japan</h2>
            <ul class="problem-facts">
                <li>95% of "senior engineers" in the market aren't actually senior.</li>
                <li>More than half of technical hires fail to meet expectations in Japan.</li>
                <li>The average time-to-hire for technical roles in Japan is 12+ weeks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The quality gap between average and exceptional technical talent isn't 20% or 30%. It's <strong>10X</strong>. One truly elite engineer is worth TEN average ones in code quality, problem-solving, system design, innovation, and leadership.</p>

        <section class="why-fail-section">
            <h2>Why Traditional Recruitment Methods Fail</h2>
            <ul class="fail-list">
                <li><strong>Generalist Recruiters:</strong> Can't distinguish real engineering ability from buzzwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Proclaimed "Tech Recruiters":</strong> Match keywords, not capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Boards & LinkedIn:</strong> Attract mostly mediocre, not exceptional, candidates.</li>
                <li><strong>Coding Tests:</strong> Reward memorization, not genuine ability.</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional Interviews:</strong> Favor presentation, not performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The result? Months of wasted time and mediocre hires.</p>

        <section class="referral-section">
            <h2>The Employee Referral Paradox</h2>
            <ul class="referral-facts">
                <li>A+ players refer other A+ players (when incentivized correctly)</li>
                <li>B+ players refer C players (to look better by comparison)</li>
                <li>Referrals have 20% better retention rates and reduce time-to-hire by 10~30%</li>
                <li>Most companies exhaust quality referrals within 6-12 months</li>
                <li>Referrals are not scalable for rapid or sustained long-term growth</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Referrals are vital, but can't be your only strategy.</p>

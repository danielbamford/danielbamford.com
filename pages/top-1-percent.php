        <h2>The Brutal Truth About Technical Hiring in Japan</h2>
        <p>Let's face facts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>95% of "senior engineers" in the market aren't actually senior.</li>
            <li>More than half of technical hires fail to meet expectations in Japan.</li>
            <li>The average time-to-hire for technical roles in Japan is 12+ weeks.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These are cold facts, and harsh statistics.</p>
        
        <p>The quality gap between average and exceptional technical talent isn't 20% or 30%. It's 10X. At least. Maybe 100x if you factor in AI-assisted coding.</p>
        
        <p>One truly elite engineer is worth TEN average ones in terms of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Code quality</li>
            <li>Problem-solving speed</li>
            <li>System design capability</li>
            <li>Innovation output</li>
            <li>Technical leadership</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Traditional Recruitment Methods Fail</h2>
        <p>Most technical recruitment approaches in Japan are fundamentally broken:</p>
        
        <h3>Generalist Recruiters</h3>
        <p>These recruiters have never written a line of code or built a product. They can't distinguish between someone who knows Python syntax and someone who can architect scalable systems.</p>
        
        <h3>Self-Proclaimed "Tech Recruiters"</h3>
        <p>They've memorized technical keywords, post on LinkedIn, but lack the cognitive framework to assess actual engineering capability. They're matching buzzwords, not evaluating talent.</p>
        
        <h3>Job Boards & LinkedIn</h3>
        <p>The best engineers aren't actively looking and rarely respond to generic outreach. Job boards attract primarily mediocre candidates seeking any opportunity. You also get zero help in screening and closing the deal.</p>
        
        <h3>Coding Tests</h3>
        <p>Most standardized tests measure memorization of algorithms, not problem-solving capability. They reward preparation, not genuine ability.</p>
        
        <h3>Traditional Interviews</h3>
        <p>They favor candidates who interview well, not those who perform well. Presentation skills ≠ technical excellence.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
        <h2>The Elite Technical Assessment Framework</h2>
        <p>The best approach is fundamentally different. It's a strategy, not a hope.</p>
        
        <p>Don't just evaluate technical skills. Assess the <em>core cognitive capabilities</em> that actually predict technical excellence and peak growth curve:</p>
        
        <div class="content-box">
            <h3>1. Abstract Reasoning</h3>
            <p>The ability to identify patterns and relationships in complex systems.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Inductive Reasoning</h3>
            <p>The capability to develop general rules from specific examples.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Deductive Logic</h3>
            <p>The skill of applying general principles to solve specific problems.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Coding Ability</h3>
            <p>The practical skill of implementing solutions in code efficiently and elegantly.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Working Memory Capacity</h3>
            <p>The ability to hold and manipulate multiple complex concepts simultaneously.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Cognitive Flexibility</h3>
            <p>The capability to adapt thinking strategies based on changing requirements.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Problem Decomposition</h3>
            <p>The skill of breaking complex problems into manageable components.</p>
            
            <h3>8. Algorithmic Thinking</h3>
            <p>The ability to develop step-by-step solutions to complex challenges.</p>
